Has Avah been working on taking personal responsibility/accountability for her actions and life choices?  Does she recognize that she can be defensive and maintain a 'victim' mindset whereby she pushes blame on others or external factors when she may bear some or all the responsibility?
Does Avah understand that a large and increasing share of her childhood/teen years are about preparing to launch out onto her own as an independent and self-sufficient adult, and have the skills and abilities to thrive?  Also, does she understand that she is ultimately the one who must take ownership and invest in herself - it won't be handed to her?

How does Avah feel about our parenting?  Understand she feels pressured.
How has she processed our recent reactions to her party, drinking
Concern over her taking proactive steps to improve her mental health. Is she taking steps to find joy/happiness?

• Front, Center, and Surrounds = “SMALL”
• Subwoofer = “ON,” or “YES,” or “PRESENT”>>> Sony = 160Hz


Phase Switch—Sit in your favorite listening position. Play music (not a movie) with
a walking bass line. We recommend playing jazz or country music. Now listen carefully
for the point at which the subwoofer transitions to your main speakers. This is the
crossover point, and this point should be below the frequency of a male human
voice. Whichever phase setting sounds louder or fuller at the subwoofer’s crossover
(transition) point is the optimum setting. Sometimes no difference will be heard",2,1,,, ,en,US/Pacific,,,Home

A “high ankle sprain” is an injury to the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. The injury is caused by the foot being dorsiflexed and externally rotated which widens the ankle joint, stressing the syndesmosis.

To make solutions by weight add either 1.25 dry ounces of powder to 1 gallon of water, or add 10 grams of powder to 1 liter of water.  Alternatively, you can add a heaping 1 ounce scoop (a large coffee measuring scoop typically works) to 1 gallon of water, or add 2 rounded Tablespoons of powder to 1 liter of water.
